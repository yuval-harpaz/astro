# astro
imaging astronomy data from JWST. Python code to download and do some post-processing for *.fits files, coming from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) via [mast](https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html).
### installation
I followed the instructions recommended [here](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdat_notebooks) or [here](https://spacetelescope.github.io/jdat_notebooks/install.html#install) but froze my requirements.txt just in case. Basically you need anaconda3 and astropy. I work with pycharm and matplotlib so no notebooks here.
